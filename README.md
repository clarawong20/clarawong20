- 👋 Hi, I’m Clara Wong!
- 🏫 I'm in my third year of electrical and biomedical engineering at McMaster University
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about web development and applying technology to health solutions! I hope to learn and apply these skills through hackathons, co-op experiences, and extracurriculars
- 💼 I have experience in software development and QA testing at AMD; automotive embedded software (C, MATLAB, Simulink, C++) at the McMaster Automotive Research Centre (MARC); and 3D modeling for surgical applications (SOLIDWORKS, Autodesk Inventor, 3D printing, silicon molding) at SickKids
